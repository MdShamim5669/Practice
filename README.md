# Problem Solving with TypeScript
This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of fundamental TypeScript concepts. It includes a series of problems that cover topics such as types, functions, classes, interfaces, and array manipulation.
#Problem 1:
Create a function formatValue that accepts a value which may be a string, number, or boolean, and returns the following based on the value type:

If the input is a string → return the string in uppercase
If the input is a number → return the number multiplied by 10
If the input is a boolean → return the opposite value (true → false, false → true)
